/**
 * Initializes and manages socket connections for handling real-time interactions.
 * 
 * This function listens for new socket connections and assigns them to rooms,
 * ensuring that each room does not exceed the maximum number of members. Upon
 * connection, it emits events to notify users of room assignments and updates
 * them with the current room state. It also listens for disconnection events
 * and updates room membership accordingly, deleting empty rooms when necessary.
 * 
 * Listens for the following socket events:
 * - 'connection': Assigns the new socket to a room and manages room membership.
 * - 'disconnect': Removes the socket from its assigned room and cleans up if
 *   the room is empty.
 * - 'draw': Updates the room state with drawing data received from clients and
 *   broadcasts it to all members in the room.
